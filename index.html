            <p class="bio"> I'm a computer science major that is heavily interested
              in machine learning and AI and hopes to work in that field in the future. I also love
              playing basketball, tennis, and at times football in my free time. I also am a person with
              strong opinions and love sharing them, so this page will hold some of the digital media
              related to my interests.
